# mVtoTemp
A millivolts to temperature converter web app.

Intended to be installed on Android, iOS, Windows, etc. from a browser "three dots" menu and work offline.

Could come in handy for electronic enthusiasts that own a multimeter capable of measuring Â± 0-50 mV range, but that does not come with the inbuilt temperature reading option.

The initial batch of thermocouples will include the K, J, T and E "base metal" types.

This is a personal project to keep myself engaged. No third party libraries will be used, only pure JS.

The millivolts constants for thermocouples will be taken from:
